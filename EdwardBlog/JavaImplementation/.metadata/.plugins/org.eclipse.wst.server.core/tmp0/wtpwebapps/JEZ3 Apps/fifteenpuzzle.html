					<h2>Solving the 15 Puzzle </h2>
					<p>
					This article is about solving the 15 puzzle.  It will approach various ways of solving the fifteen problems 
					and how to improve them.  It will initially discuss a brute force approach followed by using djikstra's algorithm
					and then utilizing A* to make djikstra's algorithm a little faster.  Finally parity will be discussed with 
					regards to figuring out whether or not the puzzle can be solved.  Approximately 50% of 15 puzzles cannot be solved 
					due to the parity of the board.
					<h2>Description of the 15 puzzle</h2>
					<p>
						"The Fifteen Puzzle is comprised of 15 numbered puzzle pieces 
						contained in a small 4x4 box that allows each of the numbers to slide around freely based on the fact that 
						there is always an empty space somewhere on the puzzle board." [1]  The goal of the 15 puzzle is to make all
						of the numbered puzzle pieces appear in order.  It is not always possible to do so and as such, a reward was offered
						for the solution of an impossible puzzle.
					</p>
					<h2>Generating a 15 Puzzle</h2>
					<p>
						Please note that we are only dealing with the numbers 1-15.  
						As such, it only makes sense to create the puzzle with bytes as opposed to integers.
						In the code to generate the sliding puzzle, we ensure that it is able to move various directions and
						that it records each move that is made.  The code for the sliding square and 
						the methods to solve it can be accessed <a href=blogSourceCode/slidingSquareSrc.zip>here</a>.
					</p>
<h3>Solving the 15 puzzle an initial approach - Brute Force</h3>
<p>
	Brute force is the easiest way to solve the 15 puzzle.  However, it is also the slowest way to solve the puzzle. 
	It also is unable to figure out whether or not a puzzle is solvable or not.
	It simply goes through every possible point until a solution is found.  It will even go through duplicate points.  
	This solution is acceptable for incredibly small puzzles that are solvable, but is simple to improve.  Since this method will in some cases
	never complete, the run time is infinite.
	Below is the solution for the brute force method:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" id="mainCode">
/**
 * Takes in a sliding square and returns the directions
 * taken to solve it.
 * @param sq
 * @return
 */
public static List&ltSlidingSquare.DIRECTION&gt 
	solveSlidingSquare_BruteForce(SlidingSquare sq)
{
	Queue&ltSlidingSquare&gt q=new LinkedList&ltSlidingSquare&gt();
	q.add(sq);
	while(!q.isEmpty())
	{
		SlidingSquare ms=q.poll();
		for(SlidingSquare.DIRECTION d : SlidingSquare.DIRECTION.values())
		{
			SlidingSquare moved=ms.move(d);
			if(moved==null) 
				continue;
			if(!moved.isSolved())
			{
				q.add(moved);
			}
			else
				return moved.getPreviouslyVisited();
		}
	}
	return null;
}
</pre>
<h3>Solving the 15 puzzle an initial approach - Storing Visited Nodes</h3>
<p>
The above solution does not keep track of visited nodes and will thus repeatedly access the same node and attempt to
iterate through it.  This leads to a slow algorithm at best and an algorithm that never finishes at worst.  As such, to 
solve this problem more efficiently, we keep track of already visited nodes and ignore them!  The required code changes to perform this change 
are highlighted in yellow.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" id="mainCode">
/**
 * Takes in a sliding square and returns the directions
 * taken to solve it.
 * @param sq
 * @return
 */
public static List&ltSlidingSquare.DIRECTION&gt solveSlidingSquare_BFS(SlidingSquare sq)
{
	<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Set&ltSlidingSquare&gt visitedSquares=new HashSet&ltSlidingSquare&gt();</FONT>
	Queue&ltSlidingSquare&gt q=new LinkedList&ltSlidingSquare&gt();
	q.add(sq);
	while(!q.isEmpty())
	{
		SlidingSquare ms=q.poll();
		for(SlidingSquare.DIRECTION d : SlidingSquare.DIRECTION.values())
		{
			SlidingSquare moved=ms.move(d);
			if(moved==null) 
				continue;
			if(!moved.isSolved())
			{
				<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">if(!visitedSquares.contains(moved))</FONT>
					{
						<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">visitedSquares.add(ms);</FONT>
						q.add(moved);						
					}
			}
			else
				return moved.getPreviouslyVisited();
		}
	}
	return null;
}
</pre>
<h3>Solving the 15 puzzle an initial approach - Utilizing A*</h3>
<p>
	To use A* we have to create a heuristic to guess the minimum number of moves each set has to complete.  After guessing the minimum number, which in this case will
	always be less than or equal to the actual minimum, we add each element to a priority queue.  We then grab the smallest number in the priority queue.
</p>
<h4>Choosing a heuristic</h4>
<p>
	There are multiple heuristic's to choose from.  The simplest heuristic is the Manhattan distance.  
	The Manhattan distance simply calculates the sum of every point's taxi cab distance from its current
	position to its destination.  A taxi-cab distance is the absolute sum of the cartesian coordinates
	between the two points.  This heuristic is still somewhat slow, but it is a starting point for many of the slightly more
	complex heuristics needed to efficiently solve this problem.  However, this is able to solve the 15 puzzle.
</p>

<h5>Speeding up the heuristic</h5>
<p>
	When I created my IDA* Heuristic it was initially rather slow.  Therefore I used a profiler to investigate the bottlenecks.
	The profiler I used was <a href=https://visualvm.java.net/eclipse-launcher.html>Visual VM</a>.
	The first bottleneck I saw was actually a mess up in my program.  I accidentally typed a semicolon immediately following an if statement.
	IE: if(!visitedNodes.contains(node));  Fixing this was rather simple.  However following the semicolon mistake, the constructor for the sliding squares 
	took too long to create.  This was because the constructor was inefficient at copying the previous sliding square.  To fix this, I had to change from a 2d array
	to a single dimensioned array.  Oddly enough, I think this change actually made the logic in the program simpler!  This copy constructor could possibly be sped up by using a long as opposed 
	to an array of bytes.  However, the speedup that could be seen from this is expected to be small.  Note, when copying arrays of primitive data-types use clone() to copy at a fast rate.  The current bottleneck in the code is
	based on finding previous nodes.  This could be improved with a hashmap, but I could not figure out a way to implement this fix without decreasing code quality.
